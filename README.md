# Flight finder app

Flight finder app to browse existing flights on a given date and arrival and departure locations.

## Additional notes

- The focus of this project was clean design on the frontend and developing backend endpoints to retrieve the information needed for the frontend.
- The dataset only contains flight information between Oslo, Stockholm and Amsterdam for now, so those are the only cities available.
- Because of both the limited amount of locations and flight information dates, using a different dataset and coding the endpoints accordingly or switching to an external API with more varied information is a priority regarding future work on this project.
